# Google Colab Projects Repository

Welcome to my Google Colab Projects Repository! This repository contains a collection of projects that I have worked on using Google Colab. Google Colab provides a convenient platform for writing, executing, and sharing code in Python, especially for machine learning and data science tasks.

## Projects

Here's a list of projects included in this repository:

- **Project 1**: A simple implementation and usage to show how to set up stable diffusion for Google Colab and use it.
  - Link to Colab notebook: [Project 1 Notebook]([Stable Diffusion implementation.ipynb](https://github.com/koopatroopa787/Google-colab/blob/afc736e70dfdb544025c189e44cc1c26a5ebd155/Stable%20Diffusion%20implementation.ipynb))

- **Project 2**: A Basic RAG Model implementation of Mistral 8x7b model by finetuning it with a custom dataset.
  - Link to Colab notebook: [Project 2 Notebook]([(mistral8x7b_rag.ipynb)](https://github.com/koopatroopa787/Google-colab/blob/0b76292edec2c9b4277b04c8f82592564ad56e64/mistral8x7b_rag.ipynb)

- **Project 3**: This is a Basic transformers implementation without using any pre built libraries.
  - Link to Colab notebook: [Project 3 Notebook]([transformers(self_build)2_9M_param_&_141M_param.ipynb](https://github.com/koopatroopa787/Google-colab/blob/535d048905614d828978263fae6dba3be5905342/transformers(self_build)%5B2_9M_param_%26_141M_param%5D.ipynb)

## Usage

Each project is contained within its own Jupyter Notebook. You can simply click on the links provided above to access the notebooks directly on Google Colab.

## Getting Started

To get started with these projects, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/koopatroopa787/Google-colab.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd google-colab-projects`
3. Open the desired project notebook in Google Colab by clicking on the respective link provided above.

## Requirements

Some projects may require the additional resources provided by Google Colab Pro, especially for tasks involving large datasets or intensive computations.

To run these notebooks, you'll need:

- A Google Colab Pro subscription

Please ensure that you have the required resources available before running the notebooks that require Google Colab Pro.
